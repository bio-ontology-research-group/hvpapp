## Database requirements 
  1. Download [CADD](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/download/CADD/v1.3/whole_genome_SNVs_inclAnno.tsv.gz) database file.
  2. Unzip `whole_genome_SNVs_inclAnno.tsv.gz`
  3. Download and run the script [generate.sh](http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/onto/pvp/generate.sh) (Requires [TABIX](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html)).
  4. Copy the generated files `cadd.txt.gz` and `cadd.txt.gz.tbi` to directory `phenomenet-vp-1.0/data/db`.
  5. Download [DANN](https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/DANN/data/DANN_whole_genome_SNVs.tsv.bgz) database file and its [indexed](https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public_data/DANN/data/DANN_whole_genome_SNVs.tsv.bgz.tbi) file to directory `phenomenet-vp-1.0/data/db`.
  6. Rename the above two files as `dann.txt.gz` and `dann.txt.gz.tbi` respectively. 
  

## Parameters
    --file, -f
       Path to VCF file
    --inh, -i
       Mode of inheritance (dominant, recessive, x-linked, others, or unknown)
       Default: unknown
    --model, -m
       Prioritization model to be used (Coding or Noncoding)
       Default: Coding
    --omim, -o
       OMIM ID of the input VCF file
    --phenotypes, -p
       List of phenotype ids separated by commas (HPO or MPO terms)
    --human, -h
       Do not propagate human disease phenotypes to genes
       Default: false
    --all, -a
       Keep all variants for analysis (i.e. Do not filter variants based on their annotation type as coding variants or noncoding variants)
       Default: false

## Usage:

To run the tool, the user needs to provide a **VCF file** along with either an **OMIM ID** of the disease or a **list of phenotypes (HPO or MPO terms)**.

a) Prioritize disease-causing variants using OMIM ID and coding model while keeping all variants:

	bin/phenomenet-vp -f data/Pfeiffer.vcf -o OMIM:101600 -m Coding -a
	
b) Prioritize disease-causing variants using a set of phenotypes, and parameters: coding model, and dominant inheritence mode, and filter noncoding variants from the result file

	bin/phenomenet-vp -f data/Pfeiffer.vcf -p HP:0000006,HP:0000174,HP:0000194,HP:0000218,HP:0000238,HP:0000244,HP:0000272,HP:0000303,HP:0000316,HP:0000322,HP:0000324,HP:0000327,HP:0000348,HP:0000431,HP:0000452,HP:0000453,HP:0000470,HP:0000486,HP:0000494,HP:0000508,HP:0000586,HP:0000678,HP:0001156,HP:0001249,HP:0002308,HP:0002676,HP:0002780,HP:0003041,HP:0003070,HP:0003196,HP:0003272,HP:0003307,HP:0003795,HP:0004209,HP:0004322,HP:0004440,HP:0005048,HP:0005280,HP:0005347,HP:0006101,HP:0006110,HP:0009602,HP:0009773,HP:0010055,HP:0010669,HP:0011304 -m Coding -i dominant 
   
   The result file will be at the directory containg the input file. The output file has the same name as input file with .res extension.
   
# Analysis of Rare Variants:

In order to effectively analysis rare variants, it is strongly recommended to *filter the input VCF files by MAF* prior to running phenomenet-vp on it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

a) Install [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/index.html).

b) Run the following command using VCFtools on your input VCF file *to filter out variants with MAF > 1%*:

	vcftools --vcf input_file.vcf --recode --max-maf 0.01 --out filtered
	
c) Run **phenomenet-vp** on the output file *filtered.recode.vcf* generated from the command above.
 
# Synthetic Exomes

Our prepared set of synthetic exome are available [here](http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/onto/pvp/synthetic_exomes/). This directory contains VCF-format synthetic exomes. The file `clinvar_variants.txt` contains a list of pathogenic ClinVar variants used to create the synthetic exomes (with their OMIM IDs). The i-th variant in `clinvar_variants.txt` is used to create `var_i.vcf` synthetic exome. The subdirectory `wo_maf` contains unfiltered VCF files while `with_maf/` contains pre-filtered exomes based on MAF (i.e filter out variants with MAF > 1%).
